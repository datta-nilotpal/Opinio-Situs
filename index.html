					<h3>Why are you offering free web development services?</h3>
					<p>We're in the beta phase of launching our platform and are looking to build a robust portfolio of work. Offering free web development services during the beta phase of launching a platform is a strategic move with multiple benefits, especially for businesses like ours that aim to serve specialized sectors such as the legal community.

We'll engage in a detailed discussion with you to understand your long-term needs and expectations. This conversation will cover various options for ongoing support, which might include on-demand assistance, a retainer agreement for regular updates, or providing you with the tools and training to make minor updates in-house. Our goal is to find a solution that aligns with your operational requirements, budget, and how hands-on you wish to be with your website. Whether you're looking for periodic content updates, functional enhancements, or security upgrades, we're committed to providing a flexible and sustainable support model that ensures your website continues to meet your business's needs effectively.</p>
